MongoProviders

ASP.NET Membership and Role Providers for MongoDB


## NOTE: There is a newer fork of this project located here:
https://github.com/rammicz/MongoProviders


Motivation:

This project was originally part of the MongoWSAT project but was split out so that users of MongoWSAT don't have to include the MongoProvider and MongoProvider.UnitTests projects in their solutions.  This also prevents issues regarding the licensing (see below).

Running Unit Tests:

Install the Visual NUnit plugin for VS2010 to run the unit tests.

License:

  MongoProviders - MIT

  MongoProviders.UnitTests - GPL

  Why GPL? - The MongoProviders.UnitTests project is GPL because it is a port of the Unit Tests from the MySQL Connector project which is GPL.  The reason the rest of this project can remain non-GPL'd is due to the FOSS exception as described here:
